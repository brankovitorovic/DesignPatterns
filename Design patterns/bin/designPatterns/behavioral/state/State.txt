The main idea is that, at any given moment, there’s a finite number of states which a program can be in. Within any unique state, 
the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. 
However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states. These switching rules, called transitions, 
are also finite and predetermined.
