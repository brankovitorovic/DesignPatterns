Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
Usage:
- when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
- when you want to implement reversible operations.
